# logic-app

A small proof-of-concept of a webview-based "native" app, built with Bun.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To build:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can then find native binaries in the `dist` folder.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
